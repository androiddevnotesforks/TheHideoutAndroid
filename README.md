The Hideout is an unofficial open-source Android app for [Escape from Tarkov](https://www.escapefromtarkov.com). What started as a small project 2 years ago that only showed a handful of item details, has evolved to become the most popular EFT app on Android. Jam-packed with features, a beautiful UI that's easy on the eyes, and best of all, **no ads**, *ever*.

### What's up with this `v2` stuff?
Glad you asked! `v2` is a new version I am currently working on that will leave no feature untouched, it's not a full ground-up rewrite, but it's close.

What's new in `v2`?
- Material 3
- Full utilization of the [Tarkov.dev API](tarkov.dev)
  - Near real-time flea prices (already in v1).
  - Barters/Crafts/Quests/etc always kept up to date.
- Full support for tablets and foldables with support for Chromebooks planned.
- All new animations.
- Switch from Room to Realm database for local caching.
- Lots of optimizations, better navigation framework, etc.

## Contribution
If you run into a bug or want to request a feature, please [open an issue]() in this repository.

### Translations
I am in the progress of localizing all the strings while doing `v2`, once I feel it is complete enough to start translations, there will be a contribute to translations button **here**.
